        Cluedo is a classic detective game in which player try to solve a murder by identifying the culprit, weapon,
        and location. The game includes a deck of cards that includes 6 suspects, 6 weapons, and 9 rooms. At the
        beginning of the game, one card from each category is placed away and the remaining cards are
        shuffled and every player are dealt 3 cards each.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play Cluedo:</b>
        The players then take turns moving around the game board, which represents the rooms of a mansion, and making
        accusations about the hidden cards. When a player enters a room, they can make a guess about which suspect,
        weapon, and room are involved in the crime. The other players must then show the player any cards that match the
        suggestion, and the player can use this information to narrow down the possibilities and make more informed
        accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a player makes an accusation that matches the cards that were placed away, they win the game. Otherwise, they
        lose!<br>
        Are you the detective that can solve Cluedo? <br>
        The highscore is based on number of draws.
        You are assigned to play the orange monkey.<br>
        Good luck!
